<h2>INTRODUCTORY.</h2>


<p>High birth and good breeding are the privileges of the
few; but the habits of a gentleman may be acquired by any
man. Neatness is not an art requiring the study of
a life time; on the contrary it's principles are simple, and
their practical application involves only ordinary care.</p>

<p>To gain the good opinion of those who surround us
is the first interest and the second duty of men in every
profession of life. First impressions are apt to be permanent;
it is therefore of importance that they should be
favorable. Frequently the dress of an individual is that
circumstance from which you first form your opinion. It
is even more prominent than manner. It is indeed one of
the first things noticed in a casual encounter or during the
first interview. Chesterfield has said that "He could not
help conceiving some idea of the people's sense and character
from the appearance of their dress which they appeared
when first introduced to him."</p>

<p>In the preparation of this book, it has been the aim of
the maker to give in a concise form, all that is properly
embraced in a comprehensive work on not only keeping
our wardrobes in such a state as to cause us to appear to
the best advantage, but also to give a complete instruction
in the manipulation of garments and tools used in the
process of properly cleaning, pressing and repairing all
kinds of garments for men and women.</p>

<p>A few hints may be helpful to the beginner as well as
to those in the business.</p>

<p>Observe a well dressed man or woman on the street
or elsewhere, note the make up and fitting points of their
garments, this will help the student to know good work,
and try to do as well when doing the work himself.</p>

<p>When learning the method of cleaning, repairing and
pressing all kinds of garments for men and women, it is a
good idea, if possible, to have a garment of the same sort
as one is studying close at hand, following closely the instructions
over all parts of the garment; thereby understanding
the teachings better and become more familiar
with the work.</p>

<p>Should a garment need repairing of any kind or a
button sewed on, do it and charge accordingly.</p>

<p>Never give a customer clothes that are damp from
pressing, allow them to dry before wearing or delivering.</p>

<h2>LESSON I.</h2>

<h3>EQUIPMENT.</h3>


<p>Introduction: A few hints to the beginner as well as
to those now in the business. The tools required and the
best method of using same, for work at home or for business.</p>


<h3>TOOLS REQUIRED AND THEIR USE:</h3>

<p>The tools required for cleaning, repairing and pressing
at home, or for business are as follows:</p>

<p>For work at home, use an ordinary kitchen table with
smooth top. For use in business, a table eight feet long,
three feet wide and thirty inches high (or as high as is convenient
for the presser, this may be easily determined by
using). This is called a tailor's bench. The balance of
the tools are the same for work at home or for business.</p>

<p>The kitchen table or tailor's bench may be used for
several purposes; the first of which is to place the iron,
press-jack, sponge cloth, and garment while cleaning and
pressing. Also for men to sit on while sewing.</p>


<h3>THE IRON.</h3>

<p>One may use an ordinary laundry iron (but would
advise the purchase of a solid iron or tailor's goose,
weighing from fourteen to twenty-two pounds, or
according to one's strength), one may heat the
iron on a coal range, gas or oil stove; or one
may use a gas or electric iron, which are being
used with great satisfaction, and are easily handled, being
of little trouble to operate, also doing the work well.
However, it is best to use whatever one considers most
convenient, cheapest and best for the locality in which
one resides.</p>

<p>The iron is heated and placed on the iron rest, which
has been placed on the table for that purpose, to the right
of the presser, and is applied to the sponge cloth (that has
been wrung out almost dry), causing steam to penetrate
that part of the garment being pressed, thereby refreshing
the cloth.</p>

<p>The presser should have control of the iron at all
times, also see that the iron is not too hot before using
by testing it on a piece of light colored woolen material.
If it scorches it is too hot for use, wait for a few minutes
to cool.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>When pressing move the iron from place to place, on
the part to be pressed, by lifting it clear each time, instead
of shoving it along as some do. (To shove the iron along on
the work is apt to stretch garments where not required,
and also cause wrinkles). Keep the face of iron smooth by
rubbing wax over the surface frequently, thereby removing
any lint or dirt that may accumulate from time to time.</p>


<h3>THE PRESS-JACK.</h3>

<p>A press-jack such as the tailors use, is made of two
hardwood boards, thirty-five inches long, one inch thick,
planed both sides and edges and cut egg-shape; the wide
end being eight inches in width, and the narrow or small
end, four inches wide, one forming the top and the other
the bottom.</p>

<p>Between the top and bottom are screwed two blocks
of solid wood, four by four inches, and six inches high.
The first one is screwed to the top and bottom, three inches
from the large end, and the second block is screwed to the
top and bottom, seven inches from the large end, thereby
leaving a space to the small end, of twenty-eight inches, for
convenience in handling the garments while pressing.</p>

<p>The top of the press-jack is left perfectly plain and
smooth; the bottom, however, is padded for convenience
for pressing with ten-ply of wadding, cut the same shape
of board or bottom of press-jack. Over this place a piece
of white heavy drilling, drawn tight over the wadding to
keep in place and tacked all around the edges with brass
head tacks. Cut cotton off evenly around the edges beyond
the tacks. This completes the press-jack and is
ready for use.</p>

<p>The press-jack as tailors term it, is used for the pressing
of clothes, and is also useful to lay clothes on while
cleaning.</p>


<h3>THE BRUSH.</h3>

<p>A brush with a plain back and handle. (Never use a
whisk broom to brush clothes as it injures the fibre of the
cloth.)</p>

<p>The brush is used to brush garments thoroughly before
cleaning and is used in connection with the pressing of
garments, to slap with the back the part pressed, thereby
keeping the steam in, and making the cloth sweat. The
face to brush the nap of cloth, thereby refreshing the garment,
making it look like new.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span></p>
<h3>THE SPONGE CLOTH.</h3>

<p>A sponge cloth is made of heavy unbleached cotton,
one yard and a half long, boiled in soap and water for one
hour, then rinse in clean water, thus removing the lint.</p>

<p>The sponge cloth should be dipped in warm water,
and wrung out almost dry by hand, (or one may use a
clothes wringer if preferred) thereby keeping it clean and
free from grease and dirt that may stick to it from time
to time.</p>

<p>The sponge cloth is used to lay over the "woolen press
cloth" that has been placed over that part of the garment
to be pressed, also it is the cloth which is to be dampened
and when iron is applied causes steam to be forced into the
garment thereby instilling new life into the cloth as it
were.</p>


<h3>THE UNDER WOOLEN PRESS CLOTH.</h3>

<p>Is made of a piece of plain light colored unfinished or
finished worsted one yard long and eighteen inches wide.</p>

<p>Place this under woolen press cloth over that part of
garment to be pressed, then lay the sponge cloth on top
of this, and apply the iron.</p>

<p>By using these two press cloths together, prevents
glossing the garment to a great extent, and may be used
when pressing all kinds of garments for men and women.</p>


<h3>COAT AND TROUSER HANGERS, ETC.</h3>

<p>Coat and trouser hangers are used to place the several
garments on to retain their shape after cleaning and
pressing. They are also very essential in the home to
place garments on that are not in use or being worn, it
is better to place garments on forms than to hang up by
loops that are placed on garments by tailors.</p>

<p>Other necessities used in the cleaning, repairing and
pressing of garments, are the sponge, tape measure, scissors,
tailor's chalk, needles, thimble, bodkin for pulling
bastings, a sewing machine, a large mirror, fashion plates,
chairs, desk and safe, if one wishes.</p>

<p>Afterward one may add as many tools as necessity
requires and their business permits.</p>

<h3>CLEANING.</h3>

<p>Consists of several formulas for making Standard
cleaning fluids, and the best method of using same, in the
cleaning of all kinds of garments. How to prepare
garments to be cleaned. How to steam clean.
How to dry clean. The secret of success in cleaning. To

<h3>CLEANING FLUID.</h3>

<h4>(Formula.)</h4>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 15%;">2 ounces Chloroform.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 15%;">3 ounces Wood Alcohol.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 15%;">2 ounces Sulphur Ether.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 15%;">2 ounces Spirit of Wine.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 15%;">10 ounces Ammonia.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 15%;">3 ounces Oil of Turpentine.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 15%;">2 ounces Glycerine.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 15%;">Place all seven chemicals in one bottle.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 15%;">3 ounces Borax.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 15%;">3 ounces French Castile Soap.</span><br />
</p>


<h4>DIRECTIONS TO MIX:</h4>

<p>Cut the French Castile Soap in fine shavings, dissolve
them together with the Borax, in four quarts of boiling
water, cool this solution, being careful that all the soap
is dissolved, then strain through muslin or thin woolen
cloth, to remove any sediment. Then add the other seven
chemicals, mix and shake well. This will make five
quarts Cleaning Fluid.</p>

<p>This cleaning fluid may be used on any
garment with good results, as it will not injure the fibre
of the cloth. Always rinse spot good with clean water and
sponge, after using cleaning fluids.</p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span></p>
<h3>HOW TO PREPARE A SIMPLE CLEANING FLUID.</h3>

<h4>(Formula.)</h4>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 15%;">4 ounces Ammonia.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 15%;">4 ounces Bay Rum.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 15%;">1-6 ounce Salt Peter.</span><br />
</p>

<p>To this add one pint of clean water, pour in a small
neck bottle, keep well corked to avoid evaporating.</p>

<p>This preparation will remove fresh or hard paint, tar,
grease, oil and in fact any spots from clothing, dress goods,
carpets, rugs, and all woolen goods without injury to the
fabric. The above may be obtained at any drug store.</p>


<h3>HOW TO PREPARE MOTH PREVENTATIVE.</h3>

<h4>(Formula.)</h4>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 15%;">4 ounces Powder Borax.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 15%;">4 ounces Powder Alum.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 15%;">4 ounces Powder Camphor.</span><br />
</p>

<p>Mix all three chemicals together thoroughly. This
will make a white powder. Sprinkle freely around and under
carpets before laying, also over clothing not in use.
This powder will not leave a stain, and is easily brushed
off. Use freely wherever moths appear.</p>


<h3>HOW TO USE THE CLEANING FLUIDS.</h3>

<p>Dampen a sponge or woolen cloth (white flannel is
the best as there is no color to come out) by dipping it in the
cleaning fluid, which has been poured into a basin for that
purpose and convenience. Rub the spot to be cleaned
with the dampened sponge, woolen cloth or flannel)
with the thread or nap of the cloth until the grease and
dirt is loosened, then rinse with clean water, (always rinse
sponge, cloth or flannel in clean water before cleaning the
stain a second time with pure water) until stain entirely
disappears.</p>

<p>Always clean garments before repairing or relining.</p>


<h3>HOW TO PREPARE GARMENTS TO BE CLEANED.</h3>

<p>Turn all pockets inside out. Brush thoroughly and
whip with cane if necessary, being careful not to break
the buttons on the garment.</p>

<p>See that the dust and dirt is thoroughly removed from
the pockets, then return pockets to their place. This is a
very important part and one which is very often neglected<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
and overlooked. The garment is then ready to be cleaned.
Proceed as above explained. If one application is not
sufficient to remove the spots, repeat until spots are thoroughly
removed.</p>

<p>Coats are usually very dirty and greasy around the
collar also down the fronts, great care should be taken to
clean thoroughly and rinse often, thereby removing all
stains.</p>

<p>All coats, vests, trousers, overcoats, ladies' jackets,
coats, waists, and all kinds of skirts should be cleaned by
this same method.</p>


<h3>HOW TO STEAM CLEAN.</h3>

<p>To steam clean coats, vests, trousers, overcoats, ladies
jackets and skirts and all wool garments:</p>

<p>Place each garment in a basin of warm water first, and
with soap and a brush go over the entire garment thoroughly,
including sleeve lining.</p>

<p>Second&mdash;pour water off and fill basin again with
warmer water than at first, and wash with stiff brush and
soap as before, using three waters or until garment is
thoroughly cleaned.</p>

<p>Remove soap water (do not wring garments but allow
to drip, or squeeze water out) and rinse in hot water, then
warm, then cooler, and so on until cold, adding one tablespoonful
of coarse salt. (Dissolve salt in cold water before
placing in basin). This will prevent garment from
shrinking. Place on hanger to retain their shape, allowing
water to drip out. Straighten out wrinkles as much
as possible when drying, thus making the pressing easier,
and when thoroughly dry, proceed to press as explained.
If any spots remain after this process, remove with ammonia.</p>

<p>For those who perspire under the arms freely, dress
shields placed in the bottom of the arm holes of coats will
be of great benefit.</p>


<h3>HOW TO DRY CLEAN.</h3>

<p>Use a basin large enough to hold one gallon of gasolene
and the garment to be cleaned. (Being careful to keep
gasolene away from the stove or a lighted candle, lamp,
or gas.)</p>

<p>Place one gallon of gasolene in the basin with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
coat, and swash up and down until all grease and dirt has
been loosened, then place on hangers in the open air, allowing
to dry and gasolene to evaporate.</p>

<p>Before dipping the coat in the basin, see that all dust
and dirt is removed from the pockets by turning them inside
out and brushing, also brush all seams.</p>

<p>Use half a gallon for the vest, and one gallon for the
trousers. The more gasolene used, the better will be the
results.</p>

<p>Gasolene may be used a second time on black goods,
after filtering or settling, but never on light colored materials,
ladies' jackets, coats, wool waists, and skirts may be
cleaned in the same way.</p>

<p>Gasolene, benzine, naptha, turpentine and ammonia
should be of the best and purest, when used for cleaning
purposes.</p>

<p>The secret of success in cleaning, is by dipping the
garment in a large quantity of the liquid. Not less than
a gallon of gasolene, benzine or naptha should be used for
a coat, jacket or skirt. Two gallons will do the work better.
One should remove all spots if possible before dipping
in the liquid. It is a good idea to surround each spot
with a basting thread as when wet, some spots do not
show. Soak each garment in the clear liquid, then soap
all spots thoroughly, rub gently between the hands until
spots disappear. Then wash and rinse garment in clear
liquid. Place on hangers in the open air, or drying room,
allowing odor to pass away.</p>

<p>Soap may be used for cleaning in connection with
gasolene with good results. One may use a little ammonia
with the gasolene and soap. The goods should be well
shaken, and pull all folds out straight with the threads of
the goods. Velveteen, velvet and corduroy may be
cleaned with gasolene, when pile or nap is not much worn.</p>

<p>When cleaning velvet, or any other fabric, the most
important part is to have all the dust and dirt removed,
by brushing the garment or fabric thoroughly.</p>

<p>To clean a velvet collar that is not too greasy, and the
nap not worn off: Wet a piece of woolen cloth or flannel
in gasolene and rub lightly, until the grease and dirt is
loosened. Then apply more gasolene with a clean woolen
cloth, and remove all grease and dirt. Place on hanger<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
in the open air to dry and to evaporate before steaming.
When much gasolene is used hang coat so that the collar
hangs down, to allow the gasolene to drip out and evaporate,
before steaming. Always being careful not to use
gasolene near a stove, lighted candle, lamp or gas.</p>

<p>When using gasolene for cleaning purposes, have it
in a gasolene or benzine safety can, used for that purpose,
which may be had at any hardware store.</p>

<p>To remove old hard paint or tar, apply the cleaning
fluid freely and place the sponge cloth over spot and press
with the iron, as there is nothing that will loosen paint or
tar as well as steam or heat. If one application is not
sufficient repeat until loosened, then scrape off; after that
use more cleaning fluid to remove any stains that may remain,
then rinse in clean water.</p>

<p>To remove ink stains from woolen materials:</p>

<p>Apply cleaning fluid, two or three times, washing
spots each time with clean water, and sponge until stain
disappears.</p>


<h3>HOW TO WASH WOOLENS.</h3>

<p>Place four ounces of soap bark in a gallon of water in
a kettle on a stove to boil, then add two more gallons of
water. Throw this over the goods, that has been placed
in another basin for that purpose and rub with the hands.
Rinse in warm water, and hang up to dry. Iron on the
wrong side when damp, until dry, (this will remove all
wrinkles and make goods look like new). This is especially
good for worn garments, that are to be cut and made
over.</p>

<p>Woolens should be squeezed, and not wrung, and the
wrinkles straightened out while drying.</p>


<h3>HOW TO WASH BLACK WOOLEN DRESSES.</h3>

<p>Have the dress ripped apart, brushed, and all dust and
dirt removed from the seams, also all the old stitches.
Pour four gallons of water in a pail or basin, adding four
ounces of ammonia. Dip each piece of the garment into
the liquid, and swash up and down, and squeeze as dry as
possible, then hang over a pole, and when almost dry,
iron from the wrong side until dry, with an iron not
too hot.</p>

<p>Woolen dresses, that are much soiled, may be washed
in soap and water, and rinsed out before dipping in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
ammonia water, which will improve the color to a great
extent.</p>

<p>Any material, such as worsted, and wool garments
should be sponged with ammonia and water.</p>

<p>When cleaning with gasolene, benzine or naptha, to
remove the odor, the article should be placed as near a
steam radiator as possible, or in a drying room
heated by steam or otherwise, this removes the
odor, the steam heat dries out whatever of the
fluid may have remained in the material, and
does so without the danger of explosion which makes it
impossible to dry a garment cleaned with the above near
a lighted stove, lamp, candle or gas.</p>


<h3>HOW TO WASH CHAMOIS VESTS.</h3>

<p>Wash with white soap and warm water, making a
good lather and rubbing well between the hands. Lay
flat on a table, and rub with a dry, clean cloth; rinse; then
roll in another cloth and wring as dry as possible. Unroll
and stretch well; hang up, and when nearly dry press with
a warm iron, being careful not to have the iron too hot
or it will spoil the chamois.</p>


<h3>HOW TO CLEAN SILK.</h3>

<p>Use hot gasolene, heated in a double boiler (never put
gasolene on a stove) place the gasolene in the double
boiler, after it has been removed from the stove and while
the water is still boiling, place the silk to be cleaned in
the boiler, and swash up and down until it is thoroughly
cleaned, then remove and place in the open air to dry
and evaporate.</p>


<h3>TO CLEAN BLACK SILK.</h3>

<p>Brush and wipe with flannel cloth, lay on a table with
the side to be worn up; then sponge with hot coffee (strain
coffee through muslin before using). When damp, lay
cloth on and iron until thoroughly dry.</p>


<h3>TO REMOVE GREASE FROM SILK.</h3>

<p>Use a lump of magnesia (moistened), rub on the spot
and allow to dry; then brush powder off. Repeat if necessary.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>Silks and satins should be sponged with ammonia and
water. It is not necessary to soak ribbon, unless they are
very dirty. Only black material should be cleaned with
strong ammonia as a difference in the dye stuffs may cause
the material to turn red, wherever the ammonia touches it.</p>

<p>To clean a colored silk dress, mix together four ounces
of soap, six ounces of honey, and a pint and a quarter of
gin, rub in well with small brush, rinse each piece at once
in cold water thoroughly, drain and iron while wet. This
is especially good for black, also black and white silks.</p>

<p>Silks may be stiffened by adding two or three lumps
of sugar, or half a teaspoonful of gum Arabic to the water.
Place over a round pole and while damp place a piece of
muslin over the silk and iron until dry.</p>


<h3>TO CLEAN BLACK LACE.</h3>

<p>To a cup of strong tea, add one-half teaspoonful of
gum Arabic. Dip the lace into the liquid, and squeeze it
dry, two or three times (do not wring). Roll in a cloth and
when almost dry, straighten out all the scallops carefully
by hand, being careful to have it of universal width, and
place on a soft cloth or padded board and lay a piece of
muslin over it, then iron until dry. This is suitable for
ordinary lace. But real lace should be pinned or tacked
to a board, being careful to draw out all loops of the edge,
and not drag the lace out of shape.</p>

<p>All stains and spots should be removed as soon as
possible. Ink stains may be taken out of clothing by
dipping the spot in milk, and squeezing the blackened
milk into a basin, dipping in clear milk again. Repeat
this process until the ink stain has entirely disappeared;
then wash the cloth in warm water, to remove the fat in
the milk.</p>

<p>Some inks are very difficult to remove but with a
little patience, one of the processes will remove any ink
stain.</p>

<p>To remove grease spots from delicate fabrics, requires
great care. When the color and fabric will not be injured,
use the cleaning fluid. Otherwise use French chalk or
magnesia powder. Place upon the spots, allow to
remain for a short time. This will often absorb the grease.
If one application is not sufficient, brush off and apply
again until the spot disappears.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>When water may be used on the cloth, the chalk may
be made into a paste and spread on the spot and left until
dry then brush off.</p>

<p>When color of a piece of goods has been accidentally
or otherwise destroyed by acid. Apply ammonia to neutralize
the same after which an application of chloroform
will in almost every case restore the spot to its original
color.</p>


<h3>TO REMOVE STAINS FROM COTTON AND LINEN GOODS.</h3>

<p>To remove stains from linen and cotton, wet spots
with luke warm water, then squeeze the juice of a lemon
over the stain, sprinkle with salt, then place in the sun
to hasten bleaching. If one application is not sufficient
to remove the stains, repeat until thoroughly cleaned.</p>

<p>To remove scorch from cotton, place in the hot sun
until scorch disappears.</p>

<p>To remove machine oil from white linen, cotton,
or light goods. Rub with pure white lard, then wash
with warm water and soap.</p>

<p>To remove iron rust.&mdash;Dip in medium strong solution
of oxalic acid, then hold over the spout of a boiling tea
kettle. Rinse the spot in two or three waters, then wash
in the usual way.</p>

<p>To remove Fruit and Berry Stains.&mdash;Place spot over
a bowl and pour boiling water through the cloth until
stain disappears.</p>

<p>To remove Mildew.&mdash;Rub soap on the damaged article
then salt and starch on that; rub well in and place
in the sun until spots entirely disappear.</p>

<p>Fruit, ink, blood and other stains should be removed
before the clothes are wet in the laundry. Tea,
coffee, wine and most fruit stains, can be taken out with
clear boiling water, by stretching the stained portions
over a bowl and pouring hot water through. If they do
not come out, use a solution of borax, ammonia and chloride
of lime, or burn some sulphur and hold the stains over
the fumes. Fresh ink stains may be removed by an application
of dampened salt, allow to remain for several hours,
or soak in warm milk or vinegar and water. Lemon juice
and salt placed on the spots will often suffice.</p>

<p>Grass stains are most difficult to remove. Dip the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
spots in molasses; let it remain until thoroughly saturated,
then wash out in clean water. Repeat if necessary.</p>

<p>Mud Stains&mdash;May be removed by soaking spots in
a solution of oxalic acid. Rinse in several waters; then
in ammonia and water last.</p>

<p>Cocoa stains may be removed by sprinkling borax
over the spot. Then soak in cold water, and pour on boiling
water.</p>

<p>Obstinate blood stains&mdash;Should be saturated in
kerosene, then rubbed with soap and washed in luke warm
water.</p>

<p>To prevent muslin from fading&mdash;Use a weak solution
of sugar of lead.</p>

<h3>INSTRUCTIONS IN REPAIRING.</h3>

<p>To reline all kinds of coats and jackets for men and
women. When new lining is required in coats, rip out
the old lining, starting to rip the sleeve lining, first around
top or sleeve head, then at the bottom or cuff. Now
remove the whole lining and rip apart and iron out smooth
and use as a pattern for the new, cutting new lining out
exactly same size as the pattern, down the seams, but
for convenience in working, allow two seams longer
at the bottom and two seams longer at the top.
Place one top and one bottom sleeve lining together,
Baste seams, having the two right sides of lining together,
and seam on machine, (or one may sew the seams on the
machine without basting, this may be done with a little
practice), press seams open on small end of press-jack,
baste top of sleeve lining in; all around, one-quarter
of an inch, now turn right sleeve inside out and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
baste right sleeve lining in by fastening the back
seam of the sleeve lining to that of the back sleeve
seam of coat, baste with long loose stitches, start basting
two inches below top of sleeve, to two inches within the bottom,
being careful not to get lining in too short (take one
quarter inch seam when sewing on machine), as this will
cause sleeve to draw up, and hang in wrinkles,
now fasten the front arm seams same as back, so
that each seam will come directly on top of the sleeve
seam. Turn sleeve right side out, and mark with chalk
on lining of coat at each sleeve seam and baste sleeve
seams at top of sleeve lining to correspond with the sleeve
seams of garment, and baste lining all around until one becomes
familiar with the work.</p>

<p>Now see that the lining is sufficiently long; cut lining
off even with the bottom of the cuff, and baste sleeve
lining up two inches from the bottom. Then with needle
and silk fell around both sleeves, top and bottom. Turn
sleeve right side out and remove basting stitches.</p>

<p>Rip out the body lining, starting at the right facing,
and rip down and around the pocket to one inch above
and one inch below the pocket across bottom, up side
seam, and across shoulder. Then remove lining, and iron
out smooth, to use as a pattern, for new lining as before,
leaving the left side of the lining in as a guide to the
beginner as to how the lining should be placed. Then cut
the new lining for the right side one half inch larger all
around than the pattern for allowance in shrinking, and
also for convenience while working. Then baste lining
in right side, being careful not to put lining in too tight.
Rather have it too long, but not so long that it hangs
below the bottom of garment. Coats will not hang well
with tight or short lining. Turn edge of lining in down
front, and across bottom with basting, and fasten lining
to side seam of forepart with long loose basting stitches.
Then rip lining out of left side and iron out smoothly for
a pattern, cut and baste in new lining on left side the same
as explained for the right. Now cut the back lining double
and seam down back centre seam, basting one inch plait
for ease, then press to one side, and baste in back, and
turn all edges in, down side seams, across bottom and
shoulders, and back of neck. Now fasten lining all around
arm hole to the seam, thereby holding lining in place, so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
as not to allow it to come loose. Cut lining off even with
seam all around arm hole, then baste sleeve lining around.</p>

<p>Cut lining to back of pocket, and at back end, cut
lining in a trifle to allow working, and for turning in
around the pocket, and fell lining in all around the pocket
mouth, and proceed to fell the lining, doing
the same with the left side. Now finish felling the entire
coat. Remove basting stitches, and finish garment in the
usual way.</p>

<p>Ladies' jackets and coats are relined in the same way,
also all kinds of men's coats and overcoats included.</p>

<p>When new silk facings are required for coats, remove
the old facing, and use it as a pattern for the new, and
when cutting the new facing, allow three quarters of an
inch all around for convenience, while working. Baste
new silk facing on very neat, and take time to do good
work. When basting is completed, fell all around with
fine silk, being careful not to draw the stitches tight, nor
to contract the edge.</p>

<p>Try to have the new silk facing put on so that it will
look better than the old one did when new. This will
bring you customers. The price to charge for such work
is by the hour and for material used.</p>


<h3>TO RELINE VESTS.</h3>

<p>Rip old lining and back out of right side, and iron out
smooth for a pattern.</p>

<p>Now cut forepart lining one half inch larger all around
and baste in forepart lining, observing how the left is put
in. Baste edges of lining in, down facing, across bottom
and around arm hole, (when one becomes familiar the right
sides of lining may be placed to that of the foreparts and
sewed around the armholes by machine, thereby saving the
felling by hand).</p>

<p>Now rip left inside lining out and replace it with new
lining, same as the right. Fell all around, then iron the
back lining out smooth for a pattern, cutting it exactly
the same size as the old one, and mark with chalk, where
seam was sewn before. Cut inside lining the same size,
and seam back seams on the machine, and press open
(or one may stitch to one side), place right sides together
to sew; smooth with iron, and baste the right forepart,
side seam to that of the back lining, also to the
shoulder. Baste left side the same way. Now baste the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
inside lining to inside of vest. This will leave an opening
at the top of neck and bottom. Now baste, placing both
back seams together, and baste each way to the side seams.
This will leave an opening, now only at the neck, thereby
forming a pocket, or bag for the vest, as it were. Sew
with machine, in same seam as at first, down side seam,
across shoulder, and bottom, and around arm holes, notch
lining around back arm hole. Remove basting, and turn
vest right side out at the neck. Baste lining even around
bottom and arm hole. Now baste lining across back of
neck, inside and out, then fell entire lining.</p>

<p>When basting the shoulders of vest, have the back lining
one quarter of an inch full in the hollow of front of
shoulder, to allow for stretching, and to form a concave.</p>

<p>Should vests require to be made larger, when one has
the lining out, all one has to do, is to mark with chalk or
thread, the amount to be made larger, adding amount from
the old seam on back, and baste forepart side seams to
the mark to be made larger. If new pockets are required,
and one is not familiar with the work, remove the pocket
very carefully, observing every detail as to how it should
be put together. Iron out smooth and cut new pocket,
seam around, all but mouth, and place inside of pocket,
and turn edges in all around top or mouth of pocket, and
fell with silk same color as pocket (never remove welt
from pocket when only new pockets are required). Should
the buttonholes need repairing, repair them. Also see
that the buttons are sewed on firm. Darn all holes, and
clean and allow to dry before new lining is placed.</p>


<h3>NEW WAIST BAND LINING IN TROUSERS.</h3>

<p>Remove old one, and iron out smooth and use for
pattern. Cut new one out and baste in and fell around
tops and down sides, and fasten at pockets to hold in place.
If new buttons are required, sew them on before new lining
is placed, so as not to sew through the lining. Repair
trousers where needed.</p>

<p><b>To repair sleeves that are worn out around the bottom</b>
run a basting thread around both sleeves five inches from
the bottom of cuff, to hold lining in place, then rip sleeve
lining around the bottom, unfasten the turn up of sleeve
from the wigan, (darn sleeve edge if necessary when it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
is worn through), now baste up firmly one eighth of an
inch, or as much more as the sleeve will allow and still
be of sufficient length, (run basting one-quarter inch from
bottom), fasten the turn up back to the wigan with basting
(this basting is left in); now let sleeve lining come
down, and if it is longer than to the end of cuff; cut off
what comes below.</p>

<p>Then turn sleeve lining in on the turn up two inches
from the bottom of cuff with basting stitches, and fell
lining with silk same color as the cloth or lining. Finish
both sleeves the same. Remove basting, turn sleeves
right side out; and press all around cuff as explained.
When felling do not take long stitches, short ones look
neater and are stronger and work will have a better appearance
when finished. Should the sleeve be finished
with stitching around the cuff, finish the same when repairing.
Sew buttons on, this completes the repairing
of sleeves at the bottom.</p>


<h3>HOW TO PUT VELVET COLLARS ON COATS.</h3>

<p>Remove old one, pick out old stitches in coat collar
(the old stitches in velvet do not matter), place coat in a
convenient manner on the press-jack and press collar and
lapels into shape.</p>

<p>Cut new velvet collar one-eighth inch larger on each
side than the pattern, or larger if necessary, and steam
over an iron as explained. Stretch the edges a trifle on
each side of velvet, being careful not to leave finger or
thumb marks, and when cool, baste on coat, (silk thread
should be used when basting velvet) in collar crease
through velvet to hold in place.</p>

<p>Run another basting below crease and in the stand
of collar, and another row of basting on leaf of collar close
to the crease. Run another basting near the outside edge
of collar leaf, and form a cushion at each end to allow
ample room for ends to curl under (instead of up). See
that the velvet is not basted on too tight or too short.</p>

<p>Now turn velvet in over old seam or stitches on the
inside of coat collar, from end to end; and baste velvet
over edge and all around leaf. Now cut velvet off even
along the leaf, then fell inside of velvet to coat neck with
silk to match; and herringbone velvet to leaf all around<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
from end to end. Make a loop or hanger out of a straight
piece of lining one-half inch wide, and turn all edges in
and fold again and fell together; now sew to the coat as
before, turning both edges of loop in, and tacking same
through stand of collar. Remove all basting by cutting
each stitch and pulling out from the right side, and with
the nap of the velvet.</p>


<h3>TO STEAM COLLAR.</h3>

<p>Place iron on its side, cover with a piece of paper, over
this lay a wet sponge cloth; then hold coat collar very
close to steaming cloth (when one is familiar with the
work they may allow the collar to rest on the steaming
cloth for a minute), and move back and forth, allowing
steam to come through the velvet. Then remove the
collar and shape by hand, as when worn. Brush the nap
gently to freshen while steaming, but with a very soft
brush. Place on coat hanger, and allow to dry before
wearing or delivering.</p>

<p>Good sewing, good pressing, well finished ends and
corners, lightness of touch which holds the work without
apparently touching it, will give to the finished garment
a fresh look.</p>

<p>All these are important considerations.</p>

<p>When darning, great care must be taken to have the
work finished up neatly, as darning and mending is an art,
and like everything else, requires patience and practice.</p>

<p><b>Basting</b> is only used in the preparation of work, to
hold stuff and lining, or any two or more parts of the work
together, while it is being stitched, as none of the basting
is left in the finished garment. It is also used as a guide
for sewing and marking on light colored goods as it will
not leave a mark as would colored chalk. For ordinary
work, basting stitches should be cut every few inches and
drawn out.</p>

<p>It is impossible to prevent trousers bagging at the
knee, but here is an idea that will help materially to keep
knees in shape. Fasten a piece of silk to the forepart of
trousers on the inside to the seams and across bottom
and top seven inches above and ten inches below the knee,
being careful not to allow stitches to show through on
right side.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>Buttonholes may be made easy to work by spacing
off the number required, with pins or thread marks.</p>

<p>Mark length of hole, and stitch on a machine the
desired length, then turn at right angles and take two
stitches, then turn back and stitch other side. Turn at
right angles and take two more stitches, thereby tacking
both ends. All buttonholes may be stitched in one garment
without removing from the machine.</p>

<p>This method takes the place of serging or overcasting
and is much better for thin ravelly goods.</p>


<h3>MAKING BUTTONHOLES.</h3>

<p>Buttonholes should be overcasted or serged as soon
as cut, with fine thread or silk, the stitches should be light,
loose and even, this is done with a slanting stitch.</p>

<p>Making buttonholes: Insert the needle on the edge
of the material and when half way through, take the two
threads at the eye of the needle bring them towards you
at the right and under the point of the needle, drawing
the thread from you, making the purl or loop stitch come
directly on the edge of the buttonhole. Stitches should
lay close together just far enough apart for the purl or loop
stitch to form, always have each stitch of the universal
length so the stitches will look straight on each side of the
buttonhole, the stitches may be placed closer together at
the end as most wear comes there.</p>


<h3>DARNING A THREE CORNERED TEAR.</h3>

<p>A three cornered tear may be darned in two ways.
Commence by darning diagonally through the center,
darning back and forth towards the end of the tear until
one-half has been finished; then begin at the center and
work in the opposite direction. At the corner, the stitches
should form the shape of a fan. Another method which
is stronger, is done by darning a square in the angle, first
with the warp threads, then with the woof threads, and
finishing each end across the tear.</p>


<h3>HEMS AND THE FELLING OF SAME.</h3>

<p>A hem is a fold of goods doubled twice to prevent a
raw edge. The fold should be turned even and straight<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
with the thread of the material, on this depends the neatness
of one's work. The hem should always be turned in
toward the worker and basted firmly not too near the edge,
leaving one-eighth inch space for working. Felling&mdash;when
felling or hemming, the needle should take up only
the edge to be hemmed or felled down and just enough
to hold on the cloth or lining. When felling or hemming
take small stitches close together, even, and do not draw
thread or silk too tight as to cause the edge to have the
appearance of the teeth of a saw.</p>


<h3>BACK STITCHING.</h3>

<p>The back stitch is made by placing the needle back in
the last stitch, bringing it out once the length of the last
stitch, then placing the needle back into last stitch and
so on, being careful not to draw the thread too tight as
to have a drawing appearance, make the stitches follow each
other without leaving a space between. Back stitching
is used in places where much strain is on the seam.</p>

<p>Bias hems, such as sleeve head lining, etc.</p>

<p>All bias hems and curved edges, should have the folds
basted in.</p>

<h3>HOW TO MAKE ALTERATIONS ON GARMENTS.</h3>

<p>When sleeves are to be shortened or lengthened, have
customer try coat on, and mark with chalk, the length
desired. Then remove coat and run a basting of cotton
around both sleeves, five inches above cuff, to hold lining
in place, while doing the work. Then with a knife or
scissors, rip lining around both cuffs. Unfasten turn up
from wigan. This will allow turn up to fall down. Now<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
mark with chalk, around both sleeves, the correct length.
Turn up and baste solid, and fasten turn up, to wigan,
same as before. Now allow lining to fall down, and cut
off even all around the end of the cuff. Baste lining two
inches from the edge of cuff, and fell with silk same color
as the cloth or lining. These instructions are for shortening
sleeves.</p>

<p><b>When sleeves are to be lengthened</b>, proceed as before,
but with this difference,&mdash;should the lining, and turn up
of cuff not meet, it will be necessary to piece the lining
or sew hand facings to the bottom of sleeve, same as the
cloth in garment, or as near as possible. Then fell sleeve
lining to facing.</p>

<p><b>When sleeves are to be lengthened</b>, baste a piece of
wigan to that which is now in place, the amount to be
lengthened, and fasten turn up to the wigan, and turn
sleeve lining in two inches from the end of cuff. Fell
sleeve lining to turn up as before.</p>

<p><b>Sleeves may be lengthened</b> all of the turn up, by
sewing a piece of cloth to the sleeve, same as the garment,
same size around, and sewn in a seam on the machine.
Baste and turn edges out even, and press firm, stitch
around with machine, thereby making it firm and solid.</p>

<p>Stitch edge of sleeve to match edge of coat.</p>

<p>Fasten ends of silk thread by threading them to a
needle and taking a stitch or two, then cut off. Sew
buttons on as required. This completes the lengthening
of sleeves.</p>

<p><b>Should coat collar be too high</b>, run a row of basting
cotton, two inches below the collar seam; mark with chalk
the amount to be lowered, then rip with knife or scissors,
inside and out from crease to crease. Now baste under
collar to neck of coat first, and fasten inside of coat to the
stand of collar. Now baste the outside or top collar on
the inside to the coat in keeping with the amount lowered
and fell inside and outside of collar. Sew loop on back
of coat collar inside, and remove basting. Place coat
collar on press-jack in a convenient manner and press in
same crease as when worn.</p>

<p>Place on a coat hanger, to retain its proper shape and to
dry before wearing. (When basting under collar to coat
neck, start basting from center back seam, forward to
each side.)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span><b>When coat collar is to be raised</b>, run a row of basting
cotton two inches below the collar seam, from end to end.
Rip under collar and unfasten coat from stand of collar
inside and rip inside collar from crease to crease. Mark
with chalk the amount to be raised, and start basting from
the center back seam, forward to each side; then fasten
coat to the stand of collar, and baste inside or top collar
to the inside of coat the amount raised on the outside.
Fasten loop to stand of collar inside, remove bastings and
place coat collar on press-jack in a convenient way, press
as before and hang to dry before wearing.</p>

<p>If however, the coat collar is to be raised and one
finds that by raising, that the collar will be too long, the
collar may be cut in the center and seamed or taken off
at one end (if only raised on one side) or both as the case
may be; if raised all around, the collar must be shortened
at both ends.</p>

<p>This is a very particular piece of work, and should
not be attempted unless the garment is old, and one wants
to practice on it; this may be had by altering an old garment
for practice, as with practice, most anything may be
accomplished. (When one has had considerable experience
in this line, then it may be done without taking it
to a tailor; until then, it will be best to let the experienced
tailor do the work on a good coat.)</p>

<p><b>When a coat is too large around the neck and collar</b>,
and falls away at the bottom when unbuttoned, and bulges
at the opening when buttoned, is an indication that the
garment is not balanced properly. This may be changed
to fit perfectly in the following manner: Run a basting
three inches from each side of the shoulder seams and to
front of coat to collar end. Rip collar off from crease to
crease, rip shoulder seams from neck to within two inches
of the sleeve seam, and mark with chalk, the amount to
be taken in (as the shoulder strap is too long from neck to
bottom of arm hole and must be shortened so that the
coat will hang squarely and well balanced when unbuttoned
as well as when buttoned), mark from neck gradually
to nothing at the end of the two inches, from the
shoulder or sleeve head; this amount to be taken off the
forepart in all cases, baste back to shoulder seam and press
open, unless a trifle may be taken off the center back seam
at top, which is a good idea, so that the collar will fall
more closely to the neck. Baste shoulder and lining together.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
Now baste collar on, starting at the center back
seam, and baste forward each way, and if found too long,
shorten as explained above; fell shoulders and collar.
Finish collar neatly and press shoulder and collar.</p>

<p>When one side is to be altered (this one may see
when customer has coat on and buttoned, and one side
stands away from the neck), in that case, only change one
side.</p>

<p><b>When a coat is too large over the chest</b>, and by setting
the buttons back from the edge two and one-half inches
(which is only to be done in extreme cases) will not have
the desired effect; run a row of basting cotton around arm
hole two inches from the sleeve seam, across shoulder to
the front end of collar and two inches from the shoulder
seam. Rip sleeves and shoulders out and collar off
from end to end, press seam out smooth, and mark with
chalk the amount shoulder is to be advanced, say from
one-quarter to three-quarters of an inch, as the case may
be (this may be easily determined when the coat is on the
customer, notice the amount of lap and then judge the
amount), baste back shoulder to forepart of coat having
the top of back even with the chalk mark; seam and
press open, baste shoulder and lining together, now baste
collar on, then baste sleeve in, and seam and press open
seam as before and fix up sleeve head, and cut off end of
shoulder amount shoulder was advanced at shoulder point.
This will take surplus goods away from the front and allow
goods to go back; finish collar, shoulders and sleeves
and press.</p>

<p>Double breasted coats are different, the buttons may
be set from the edge, according to style and fashion.</p>

<p>When a coat is too large in the back, take part out
in the side seams and part out in the center back seam;
the best way to determine the amount to be taken out,
is to pin each seam a trifle when customer has coat on,
then one will get the proper effect of the alteration.</p>

<p><b>When a vest is too large around</b>, it may be pinned on
the customer, down the side seams and center back
the desired amount to be taken out; this alteration may
be done in the following manner: Rip vest across back
of neck, rip each side seam, mark with chalk the amount
to be taken in on each side seam and center back seams.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
Baste forepart to that of the back at side seams and baste
center back seam together, lining and outside.</p>

<p>Seam on machine, remove the basting, turn vest right
side out and fell across back of neck. Press side seams,
back and around neck; place on hanger to retain shape.</p>

<p><b>When vest is to be made larger</b>, proceed as follows:
Rip side seams and across the back of neck, press out side
seams of back, and remove stitches, and if there is an
outlet, mark with chalk the amount to be let out on each
side, and baste as before and finish the same. If there is
no outlet, one must sew a piece of lining to the outside
and inside lining; press open the seams or stitch to one
side and press. Then mark with chalk the amount to
be let out and proceed as explained and finish.</p>

<p><b>When trousers are too long</b>, they may be shortened
in the following manner: Mark with chalk (using the
tape line for measuring length) the desired length, loosen
the bottoms, (if felled, rip with knife or scissors, being
careful not to cut the cloth), if there is rubber in the bottoms,
wet a piece of cloth with gasolene, and rub over
the outside and pull turn up free from the bottoms.
Turn trousers inside out, allow to dry after using
gasolene before turning up bottoms. If rubber is
to be put in the bottoms, cut a piece one inch and a half
wide, and baste in the turn up or hem and fasten hem to
the side seams with silk, only leave a two inch turn up,
cut balance off.</p>

<p>Before pressing, place on the small end of press-jack
and press all around as in pressing cuffs or bottom of
trousers as explained. (But not with sponge cloth, only
with iron and wet bottoms with sponge). Press until
rubber is thoroughly melted and set. When one has
pressed both bottoms all around, turn trousers right side
out and press bottoms as in ordinary pressing.</p>

<p>When bottoms are felled, leave two inches for turn
up and cut off the balance. Fell with silk all around, being
careful not to let stitches show through on right side.
Press bottoms same as explained.</p>

<p><b>When trousers are to be lengthened</b>, loosen them at
the bottom measure with tape line, the desired length,
from crotch down, making them one inch shorter in the back
or according to fashion. Mark with chalk the desired
length, and place rubber or fell as the case may be, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
press as explained; but if trousers are to be lengthened,
all. It will be necessary, to sew a piece of cloth to the bottoms
same size and same cloth (or as near as possible),
sew on machine and baste edges out even, and place rubber
or fell; press bottoms and finish in the usual way
by turning trousers right side out, and pressing bottoms
and legs. Sew heel protectors on (they may be made of
silesia by turning all edges in, or made of cloth, same
material as trousers) half inch wide and four inches long,
sewn half; each side of the center or crease of back trouser
bottom. This must be sewed to the inside of bottom.</p>

<p><b>When trousers are too large around the waist</b>, mark
with chalk (or pin on customer), the amount to be taken
in, rip back seam down as far as is required. Remove the
two back suspender buttons and rip lining back far enough
for convenience in working. Baste the back seam together
and sew in the chalk mark (by machine or by
hand) to within two inches of the top of waist band; press
seam open and fasten back seam at waist to the waist band
on each side and leave an outlet one inch and a half wide,
each side of the back seam at the top, tapering to nothing
at the bottom or three inches from the inside leg seam.</p>

<p>Sew back suspender buttons on two inches each side
of back seam. Put a good neck on buttons to allow
suspender button holes to fit smoothly around button.
This may be done by placing a match or pin over the top
of button and sewing over it, filling the holes with twisted
thread or button cord made for that purpose, as explained
in (how to make button cord.)</p>

<p>When holes are filled, remove the match or pin, and
wind cord around under button, and fasten by taking two
stitches through the neck, and cut thread off. Now fell
lining back in place, leaving an opening at top of, say two
inches in back seam for ease. Press and finish in the
usual way.</p>

<p><b>When trousers are to be made larger around waist</b>,
rip lining three inches each side of the back seam at top
and remove the two top back suspender buttons. Rip
back seam down the required amount and press out the
mark made by the seam. Now with the chalk, mark the
amount to be made larger, half the amount on each side
of seam, baste seam and sew on machine or by hand in chalk
mark. Remove basting, and press seam open, fasten to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
each side of the seam at waist as before, leaving two inches
open at the top for ease. Sew two back suspender buttons
on; and fell waist band lining. Finish and press in the
usual way.</p>

<p><b>When trousers are to be made larger at the waist</b>, and
there is nothing to let out, remove back suspender buttons
as explained, and waist band lining. Cut a piece of
cloth "V" shape as long as is necessary and of the same
material or as near as possible; make this piece two seams
wider than required. This may be determined by the
amount to be made larger, (the larger the piece at the top,
the longer the wedge will have to be, as it will not do to
have an abrupt slant). Baste right sides of cloth and
trousers together, sew on machine and remove basting
and press open the seam. Then baste other side and
seam, then press open; fasten a piece of canvas across the
top of waist where piece has been set in, and stitch with
machine across, in keeping with the stitching on the waist
band. If no waist seam, just stitch even with the waist
stitching. Sew back suspender buttons on, and fell waist
band lining at top, and finish as explained, fastening waist
band lining to seams to hold it in place; press and finish.
When pressing seams, always press on the smooth side
of the press-jack, and dampen with the wet sponge, this
will make pressing easier; but do not put too much water
on seams.</p>

<p><b>How to make button cords for sewing on buttons</b>.
Thread a needle with linen thread double, then rub beeswax
up and down the thread; then twist, and when one
has twisted enough, rub with a piece of cloth. This will
help to keep the twist in the cord and make it strong,
which is very essential in sewing on buttons; one knows
how annoying it is to have buttons coming off; this may
be prevented by sewing them on good with twisted thread.</p>

<p>When using silk thread, always draw it through beeswax
and rub through cloth to remove excess wax. This
will make the silk stronger, and also will slip through the
cloth more easily when sewing.</p>

<p><b>A good method of hanging a skirt.</b> Have customer
stand on top of the stairs, the fitter sitting on the second
step. This is an easy way to see that skirts hang evenly
all around, marking the proper length without rising, or
getting on the knees or sitting on the floor.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span><b>Ironing over buttons made easy and safe.</b> Place four
ply wadding on press-jack, buttons facing wadding. Iron
from the wrong side until dry. This is equally good in
ironing embroidery waists. (When ironing embroidery
white wadding should be used.)</p>

<h2>LESSON V.</h2>

<h3>PRESSING.</h3>


<p>How to sponge and shrink all kinds of woolen goods
for dressmakers and tailors, before making into garments,
also for one's own use at home. How to use the iron and
sponge cloths. How to press hard finished worsteds.
How to press single and double breasted sack coats, overcoats,
rain coats, Tuxedos, motormen and conductors, also
fatigue coats, cutaways, morning, dress coats, Prince Alberts,
military, clerical, uniforms, footman's liveries, Newmarket,
Paddock and Palitot. All kind of jackets, coats
and skirts for ladies. How to press single and double
breasted vests with or without collars, also clerical and
fancy vests. How to press trousers.</p>

<p>How to sponge and shrink all kinds of woolen goods
for dressmakers and tailors, before making into garments,
also for one's use at home.</p>

<p>To prepare a sponge cloth for that purpose, use unbleached
cotton four yards long, (or as long as the cloth
to be shrunk requires), boil in soap and water for one
hour, rinse in clean water to remove any lint, then it is
ready for use.</p>

<p>Place woolen goods to be sponged on a table or clean
floor, then wet the sponge cloth by dipping it into a pail
or basin of warm water so that it will get thoroughly wet,
wring out almost dry (but not so dry as when pressing)
and place over the goods smoothly, see that the cloth is
free from wrinkles. Make a flat roll six inches wide, or
as wide as a wrapping board would be (do not roll on a
board as it will leave a mark difficult to remove). Roll
evenly until cloth to be shrunk is thoroughly covered, sides
and ends with sponge cloth.</p>

<p><b>Time required for goods to remain in sponge.</b> Close
woven material, such as hard finished worsteds, broad
cloth, kerseys, meltons and beavers, require to be left in
sponge three hours while open wove goods, such as homespuns,
unfinished worsteds, soft overcoatings, and ladies'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
cloth requires but two hours. When goods is ready to be
taken out of sponge, unroll and place over a round pole,
(sufficient height to allow cloth to clear the floor), or
lay smoothly on a table or floor.</p>

<p>When dry, fold (not roll) double, and so on until you
have a fold seven or eight inches wide, and small enough
to place in a package.</p>

<p>The wrinkles may be pressed out with a warm iron,
being careful not to allow gloss to form, and see that iron
is not hot enough to burn or scorch cloth. Also to see
that ends are even especially on stripes and checks, and
to see that checks and plaids match.</p>

<p>When pressing always have the iron to the right on
the table, the edge of the garment facing toward the
presser. Start pressing the right side of all garments first.
In this way forming a system of doing the work.</p>

<p>When pressing all kinds of coats, vests, ladies' jackets
and coats, have the neck, collar, or waist seam lying on
the small end of the press-jack, and start from the center
back seam of all coats and vests, and press forward on
the right side, toward the front edge.</p>

<p>To press the left side of all coats and vests, reverse the
press-jack and garment so that neck, collar waist seam
or band is lying to the left. Commencing as before, from
the center back seam of garment, and continue pressing
left side, and around to the front edge, which must be
facing the presser.</p>

<p>Coats, vests, jackets and coats, should be placed on
hangers to retain their proper shape.</p>

<p>A good iron rest for the table, is made by nailing a
smooth horseshoe to a block of wood, a trifle larger than
the shoe.</p>

<p>When using the under woolen press cloth, cotton
sponge cloth and iron, lay the under woolen press cloth,
and sponge cloth on that part of the garment to be
pressed, and apply the iron until sponge cloth
shows signs of drying. Then remove the
cloths and iron, and slap with the back of the brush
that part just pressed, to refreshen same, and brush the
part pressed, with the thread or nap of the fabric; thus
making the garment look like new. Go over the entire
garment (and all garments) in this manner until the whole
garment has been pressed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>When trousers have been pressed, place them over
a round pole, suspended from the ceiling, or fastened to
the wall with brackets. A still better way is to place them
on individual hangers.</p>

<p>Do not give customers garments damp from pressing,
place them on hangers and allow them to remain for
one hour before wearing or delivering.</p>

<p>Do not try to press clothes that are damp from cleaning
or otherwise. Allow them to thoroughly dry, when
they will press more easily, and customers better satisfied,
by giving them first-rate work.</p>

<p>When a garment has been pressed all over, examine
it thoroughly for gloss, and where any appears, remove it
as explained (in how to press hard finished worsteds.)</p>

<p>This process should be followed carefully when pressing
all kinds of garments.</p>

<p>When pressing, the iron should never be shoved or
pushed, as in ironing, as before explained; as it is apt to
stretch where not required. Only heavy materials require
heavy pressing or great strength. Whatever the material,
pressing is work that requires to be done carefully and
slowly. When pressing seams, allow the iron to touch
only the center of the seam, then the edges of the seam
will not be outlined on the outside of the garment. This
however, is only intended for light weight goods, as when
pressing seams in heavy material, it is necessary to press
more solid.</p>

<p><b>How to press hard finished worsteds.</b> When pressing
hard finished worsteds, place under woolen press cloth,
and sponge cloth over the part to be pressed, (wring
sponge cloth as nearly dry as possible), and apply the iron,
not too hot, allowing it to rest until sponge cloth is entirely
dry. (This is termed by tailors, as dry pressing or glossing).
Now remove iron, and press cloths and place a
damp part of the sponge cloth over that part just pressed,
to remove the gloss, if any, by applying the iron lightly,
and slap with the back of the brush while steaming. Also
brushing the nap of the cloth.</p>

<p>Avoid stretching while pressing especially the edges
and collar, unless it is required, (and the presser understands
where to stretch, and is familiar with the fitting
qualities of the garment.) When pressing around the
pockets, have flaps on the outside, and turn pockets inside<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
out before cleaning, that all dust and dirt may be removed,
then return the pockets to their proper place before starting
to press.</p>

<p>When a coat or vest is placed on the table or press-jack,
to be pressed, and one notices fullness along front
edges and bottom, press fullness away by laying under
press cloth and sponge cloth over part to be pressed and
leave iron until sponge cloth is entirely dry, then remove
cloths and apply a damp part of the press cloth, and iron
again to remove gloss as explained before. Always have
edge of garments pointing toward the presser. This may
be learned and accomplished in a short time with little
practice.</p>

<p><b>How to clean and press single and double breasted
sack coats, motormen and conductors, also fatigue</b>: Brush
thoroughly, and if necessary whip with cane, being careful
not to break the buttons on the garment. Turn all pockets
inside out, and have flaps on the outside. Remove all
spots; special care must be taken to remove grease and
dirt from the collar, also the fronts, with the cleaning fluid.
Place on coat hangers and when dry, proceed to press as
follows:</p>

<p>Have coat lying on the table or tailor's bench to the
right, draw the right cuff over the small end of the press-jack
which should be pointing to the right. Lay the
sponge cloths over that part of the garment to be pressed,
(which you have prepared by wetting in a pail or basin
of warm water used for that purpose and wrung until almost
dry), then apply the iron until the sponge cloths
shows sign of drying. Then remove the sponge cloths
and iron, and slap with the back of brush (as has been explained.)</p>

<p>Continue this around the right sleeve cuff, and also
the left. Then with the coat in the same position, reverse
the press-jack and place the right sleeve, top side up on the
large end of the press-jack, being careful to have the sleeve
smoothed out nicely, then lay sponge cloths over and apply
the iron, pressing full length and width, up and down the
sleeve, (being careful to see that no wrinkles are pressed
in the sleeve.)</p>

<p>Remove the cloths and iron as before, slapping with
the back of the brush, then brushing the nap to refreshen
the cloth.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>Turn sleeve over and press under side of sleeve the
same.</p>

<p>Press left sleeve in the same manner. Crease sleeves
front and back, if requested by customer.</p>

<p>Reverse the press-jack and draw right shoulder of coat
over the small end of the press-jack in a convenient manner,
and press around the armholes, by laying the sponge
cloths on the part to be pressed. Apply the iron as before,
and then slap with the back of the brush. Now press
around left shoulder and arm hole in the same manner.</p>

<p>Next place the coat so that the collar points to the
right on the large end of the press-jack. Lay the sponge
cloths on the back of the coat, applying the iron as before,
and press down back and around right side of coat to the
front edge; always having the edge of the garment toward
the presser. Reverse press-jack and coat, then as before,
commence pressing at the center back seam, and forward
to the front edge. This completes the left side.</p>

<p>Place the coat on table or tailor's bench, and reverse
press-jack; lift coat and place collar or press-jack in a
convenient way, so that the collar and lapel, when pressed,
will be creased the same as when worn.</p>

<p>Commence pressing from the center of collar to the
right side of lapel, being careful not to stretch the edges
of lapel or collar. Then from the center of collar at the
back, press forward on left side as before. Turn coat inside
out, and smooth lining with cool iron, and with an
almost dry sponge cloth. This will remove any wrinkles,
and leave the lining smooth.</p>

<p>Now press the right side of facing and lapel, by laying
four-ply of wadding on the press-jack, and place right forepart
of coat so that the buttons face toward the wadding,
and press on the wrong side, the buttons will sink into the
wadding thereby avoiding the breaking of same, which
is very easily done if great care is not taken. Now remove
the wadding and press left side on the padded side
of press-jack in the usual manner. Now turn the coat
right side out, place right shoulder in a convenient manner
on the small end of the press-jack, and if any wrinkles appear
on top of the right sleeve head, press them out. Do
the same with the left side.</p>

<p>Look coat over thoroughly for gloss, if any appears,
place coat on press-jack in a convenient manner and remove
as explained.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>When pressing coats, be careful to have the flaps on
the outside, the pockets returned to their proper place inside,
before starting to press.</p>

<p>Roll fronts of coats to the inside, so that they will retain
their proper shape, also to give to them that chesty effect,
which is very essential, in the pressing of all kinds of coats,
and vests. One will soon become familiar with the work
by a little practice.</p>

<p>Place coats on hangers to dry before wearing or delivering.
Sack overcoats, rain-coats and Tuxedos, are
pressed in the same way.</p>

<p><b>How to clean and press cutaway dress, Prince Albert,
military, clerical, uniforms, footman's liveries, Newmarket,
Paddock and Palitot.</b> The above garments are cleaned and
pressed the same as other garments, but with this difference:&mdash;Coats
with skirts are pressed from the collar or
neck to the waist line or seam, then moved up to the waist
line or seam, and pressed from that to the bottom of skirt,
and around to the front, having the edge of the garment
pointing toward the presser. All coats lined with silk are
pressed very lightly, especially lapels and facings (as the
mark of the iron shows easy; and on silks is difficult to remove.)</p>

<p>Silk should look fluffy in a garment, and therefore
does not require much pressing. Great care must be taken
when cleaning, pressing, and repairing dress suits,
Tuxedos, Prince Alberts, and any garment that is silk
lined. The price to charge for such work may
only be figured by the amount of silk, and time
required to do the work. Silk facings may be had by
mailing samples to this office, and we will send price list.</p>

<p><b>How to clean and press ladies' jackets and coats</b>:
Brush thoroughly, and if necessary, whip with cane to remove
all dust and dirt. Remove all spots with the cleaning
fluid, place on hangers, and when dry, press as follows:
Ladies' jackets and coats are pressed the same as men's,
but with the following differences: Press around cuffs,
sleeves and shoulders on the small end of the press-jack,
then start at the center back seam and press forward to
the front edge, having the collar or neck pointing to the
right. Always have the edge of the garment facing the
presser. Reverse the press-jack, coat or jacket, and commence
pressing as before, down the back seam and around<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
left side to front edge. Lay sleeves on the press-jack and
press as before, being careful to have plaits in the right
creases and the gatherings in their proper place. Do not
allow more plaits or wrinkles to form on the top of the
sleeves than is needed.</p>

<p><b>How to clean and press all kinds of skirts for ladies</b>,
Brush thoroughly and whip if necessary, turn the skirt
inside out, and brush dust and dirt, from the seams and
bottom. Clean all grease spots, if any, with the cleaning
fluid, place on hangers, and when dry, press as follows:
Draw skirt on press-jack with the waist band pointing to
the left, on the small end of the press-jack; the skirt to
be drawn on the press-jack to the left. Use the sponge
cloths and iron the same as when pressing other garments.
Press around the top of the skirt and as far below as the
press-jack will allow. If skirt is plaited, be careful to have
the plaits lying smooth on the press-jack, either pin or
baste plaits in their proper creases before starting to press.</p>

<p>When pressing thin skirts, it is not necessary to press
very hard, only until the steam arises, then slap with the
back of the brush to keep steam in the goods, also to refreshen
the garment. Place on skirt hangers to dry before
wearing or delivering. Always look for gloss, and if any
appears, remove as explained.</p>

<p><b>How to clean and press single and double breasted
vests, clerical, with or without collar</b>: Brush thoroughly
and whip with cane, if necessary, to remove dust and dirt,
being careful not to break the buttons on the garment.
Turn all pockets inside out to remove all dust and dirt
from them. Then remove all spots with the cleaning fluid
as explained. Place on coat hanger, and when dry, press
as follows: Place the right forepart of the vest smooth
on the press-jack, with the edge facing the presser, and the
neck or the collar pointing to the right. Cover with
sponge cloths and apply the iron until the cloth shows
signs of drying. Remove and slap with the back of the
brush, then brush the nap of the cloth to refreshen and
make it look like new, being careful not to stretch the opening
when pressing the forepart and shoulders.</p>

<p>When pressing the foreparts of vests, start at the side
seams, and press forward to the front edge. Now reverse
the press-jack and vest and press left side in the same
manner, around the shoulders and arm holes. Now smooth
the wrinkles from the back, starting from the center and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
pressing forward to the right side seam; then press the
left side in the same manner. This removes the wrinkles,
and may be done with almost dry sponge cloth and medium
warm iron.</p>

<p>All vests are pressed in the same way, with the exception
of fancy or white vests. With these use a plain
white cotton cloth, and wet sponge with clean water.</p>

<p>Fancy wool vests should be dry cleaned before pressing.</p>

<p>Wash vests require a little thin boiled starch to give
body to goods, then iron when almost dry. Turn all pockets
inside out before starting to press. The pockets are
pressed first, then returned to their proper place, thereby
keeping the mouth of the pocket neat and even. Continue
the ironing until the vest is completed. With a little practice,
one will soon become familiar with the work. Always
being careful not to stretch the opening. Rather shrink in,
by pressing in a half circle from left to right toward the
front edge.</p>

<p>When pressing vests examine the pockets and see if
there is a chamois watch pocket, if there is sew or fasten
a piece of cloth on the outside of vest pocket as a reminder
not to press over the pocket; if you did it would spoil the
chamois, and a new pocket would have to be put in for the
customer.</p>

<p><b>How to clean and press trousers</b>: Brush thoroughly
from the right side, and whip, if necessary, then turn them
inside out. Also the pockets. See that all dust and dirt
is thoroughly removed, also lint from the seams. Then
turn right side out, and remove all dirt and grease spots
with the cleaning fluid as explained. Place on hangers,
and when dry, proceed to press as follows: Place trousers
flat on a covered table with the knees up (trousers being
turned inside out) wet bags at knee with sponge. Apply
the iron, not too hot and press in a circle to the center,
to remove and shrink away the bag; now do the same with
the left leg. Turn trousers right side out, and press
around bottoms, same as in pressing the cuffs on coats.
Reverse press-jack and trousers, and press around tops
with sponge cloths and iron as far down as seat line or
end of fly, starting from the right side of fly and pressing
around to the left fly. Remove the press-jack and lay
trousers flat on the table or bench that has been covered
with felt or cloth (melton, kersey or thibet). Place creases<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
at the bottom together with the left hand, and with the
right hand place the two top suspender buttons together,
then lay them flat on the bench or lengthwise of the
table. Then turn the left leg back as far as the seat
line, and straighten the right leg out smooth on the
table. Cover with the sponge cloths and apply the
iron, pressing full length of leg, until cloths shows sign
of drying, pressing the front and back creases sharp.
Then remove the iron and sponge cloths, then slap
with the back of the brush to refreshen and brighten
the cloth or garment. Now turn the leg over and
press other side in the same manner; then turn leg over
to inside as at first and bring the left leg down to meet the
right bottom. Turn trousers over, and then turn the right
leg back, and proceed to press the left inside leg the same
as right. Turn left leg over and press outside. Now turn
left leg over to inside as at first, bringing the right leg
down to meet the left at the bottom, then have both legs
lying perfectly even on top of each other. Press them together
from fly or seat line, down to the bottom. Turn
trousers over, and press other side in the same manner,
using the back of brush for slapping and face to brush nap
of cloth. Then place the press-jack on the table again,
with the small end pointing to the right, then draw the
right bottom of the leg over the small end of press-jack,
and press crease out through the turn up. Do this at the
front and back about two inches from the bottom. Now
press the bottom of left leg the same way.</p>

<p>Some customers do not want this crease taken out,
then of course it is to be left in. But custom-made trousers
are usually not pressed through the turn up.</p>

<p>This completes the pressing of trousers, place on hangers
before wearing or delivering. By practice, one may
soon become an expert.</p>

<p>Broadfalls are pressed in the same way. Examine for
gloss, and if any, remove as explained.</p>

<h2>LESSON VII.</h2>

<h3>CARE OF CLOTHES.</h3>


<p>Under this lesson is explained the care of clothes.
How to keep them looking fresh and clean. How to be
well dressed.</p>

<p><b>Care of clothes</b>: Cleaning, brushing, repairing and
pressing frequently is a step in the right channel, for a
man's appearance depends largely upon the care he takes
of his clothes. Clothes should be brushed often especially
after being worn in the dust and dirt, and should be hung
up in a clean place where they will be out of the dust.
Coats and vest should always be placed on coat hangers
together to retain their shape, and to be ready for wear
when wanted. The loop at the back of the coat collar,
should never be used to hang coats up by but for a few
minutes, as the weight of garments will pull the collar out
of shape.</p>

<p>Trousers after being brushed thoroughly, should be
turned inside out, and placed on hangers, by doing this
you are reversing the folds and wrinkles that have formed
while wearing, thereby allowing the cloth to fall back into
place. It is impossible to prevent trousers bagging at
the knees, but may be prevented in this way. Fasten
a piece of silk to the forepart of trousers on the inside to
both leg seams across top and bottom of silk, seven inches<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
above and ten inches below the knee, being careful when
sewing not to let the stitches show through on the out
side. Another suggestion and a good one, is to buy two
pairs trousers with each suit (except a dress suit, then it is
not necessary) and wear them alternately, two days at a
time, and have them pressed each time you change, and
turned inside out each night.</p>

<p>It is a good idea to have a row of hooks at the top of
one's wardrobe from which to hang these forms, thereby
saving much space especially in the smaller houses. Care
should be taken to draw trousers up well when wearing,
so that they will set properly. When trousers are worn
without suspenders, they must be cut shorter waisted,
shorter in the legs and closer around the waist. If one
wears suspenders it is a luxury to have a pair for each
pair of trousers. Then when one adjustment is made saves
any further bother.</p>

<p>Brushing clothes is a very simple but necessary operation,
a fact which few people thoroughly appreciate. Fine
clothes require brushing lightly with a soft brush, except
when mud is to be removed, then a stiff brush should be
used, after garment has been lightly beaten to loosen the
dirt. Never use a whisk broom to brush clothes as they
injure the fibre of the cloth. When brushing lay the coat
on a table, and brush in the direction of the thread or nap
of the fabric.</p>

<p>A well made, well fitting garment should not be
thrown away when slightly worn, but should be repaired,
cleaned and pressed. Many times lasting as long after
being repaired as at first. Unless absolutely necessary
never patch, when darning will answer the purpose better.
If the garment is not too badly worn baste a piece of cloth,
the same as the material in the garment (or as near as possible)
under the weakened part and darn to this piece. One
may back stitch with silk to match the cloth, or make a
small running stitch. When the entire part has been thoroughly
darned, turn the garment inside out and herringbone
all around the piece of cloth (or patch to the inside)
being careful not to allow stitches to show through on the
outside. Press and they are ready for wear. This is
especially good when repairing the seat of trousers.</p>

<p>Tape is invaluable in repairing, as it may be used to
strengthen weak places and where buttons are to be sewed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
acting as a stay, also saving time of turning the edges of
the cloth in, and is less clumsy.</p>

<p>Ruskin says, "Clothes carefully cared for, and rightly
worn, show a balance of mind and respect."</p>

<p>The freshness of a garment depends upon the care
taken of it, and only requires a few minutes each time they
are taken off; they should be carefully brushed, to remove
all dust and dirt, removing all spots, buttons sewed
on and replaced when worn, new braid on the bottoms of
skirts, cleaning and pressing, making little necessary alterations.
All these little duties given proper attention,
will keep a wardrobe fresh and in good order.</p>

<p>It is not always the wear on the clothes, that tell so
sadly upon them. It is the care that they receive. A few
garments, well made and properly fitted, and good care
taken of them, is far more preferable than a number of inferior
quality and make.</p>

<p>When clothing is laid away for another season, they
should first be thoroughly brushed, repaired, cleaned and
pressed, to be ready for wear when needed. If placed in
bags or boxes, the moth preventative should be sprinkled
over freely. Tailors' boxes are very good to place garments
in, that are not in use, and should be labeled on the
outside as to the contents.</p>

<p>Fold all articles on the seams, if possible, being careful
when folding sleeves and collars. Coat lapels should be
turned to lie flat; collars turned up, and the coat folded in
the center back seam, sleeves lying together and on top
of each other. Then fold in half crosswise, and place in
the box.</p>

<p>If fancy waists and coats are put in drawers, fill the
sleeves with tissue paper. This will prevent wrinkling.</p>

<p>To be well dressed, one's clothes must be of good material
and fit well. The length of waist, and full length
should be in proportion to the wearer, or as near fashion
as good taste will permit. Sleeve the right length, and
hang properly, and to come to the root of the thumb. The
collar must fit close around the neck, the lapels should be
neat and even, the opening in front should close without
bulging when buttoned, and should have no cross wrinkles
under the back of arms, and no wrinkles below the collar.
The whole appearance of the garment must be easy, the
chest should be of the athletic style (chesty), while the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
waist should be close fitting and flat (not tight). The
arm hole should not be too deep so that the coat will remain
in its proper position while sitting as when standing.
The buttonholes must be neat, and the buttons sewed on
good and strong with neck.</p>

<p>The overcoat should be easy, not clumsy, and of
fashionable length, sleeves to cover the under coat, and to
fit close around the neck (sleeves of a rain coat may be
longer than those of an ordinary overcoat), and must be
the same length at front and back at bottom.</p>

<p>A vest should fit easy to allow the body to slip up and
down, whether sitting or stooping, more especially the
former.</p>

<p>A great many people make the mistake by having their
vests made snug. One will never get a good fitting vest
in this way. A vest should come up close around the collar,
and high enough, so that it will not crawl under the
linen collar, this may be avoided by having a good tailor
make one's clothes.</p>

<p>Trousers should be the proper length, and of ample
size over the hips, knee, and to fall gracefully over the
shoe at the bottom, (some wear them very short with cuff
or French bottoms, this is a style for college towns, and is
not universal.) The waist should be the proper height
and size around, (for trousers worn without suspenders,
the waist must fit closer and cut shorter waisted). Stout
men do not want their trousers very long waisted
and up under their arms, therefore great care
must be taken when selecting, cutting and making
stout men's trousers. When trying on a pair
of trousers, or in fact any garment, stand before the mirror
in one's natural position, do not twist and turn, and cause
wrinkles to form all over the garment, and when
looking at the trousers, look at them in the mirror; do
not look down upon them as many do, and often condemn
a good fitting pair of trousers, because by stooping
and looking down, wrinkles appear that when standing
natural, hang smooth and straight.</p>

<h3>FOLDING CLOTHES.</h3>


<p>How to fold coats, vests, trousers, ladies' jackets,
coats and skirts. How to place each garment in boxes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
for storing, delivering, shipping, the marking names and
addresses on same.</p>

<p>How to fold all kinds of coats, for delivery, traveling,
storing, or shipping. Turn sleeves back to the collar, so
that the folds come at the bend of the elbow, now turn
the lapels and fronts back over the folded sleeves, then fold
the skirts over and up level with the collar, so that the
crease will fold about the center of the garment, then
double one-half over the other so that the folds come in
the center back seam.</p>

<p><b>To fold vests</b>: Place two foreparts together right
side out, having the edges and side seams even and on top
of each other, then fold back over fronts of vest so that
back seam lays perpendicular with the front edge,
straighten wrinkles out of shoulder. Then fold neck, or
collar down level with the bottom, so that the crease will
fold about the center of the garment, or bottom of arm
hole.</p>

<p><b>To fold trousers</b>: Place two top suspender buttons
together and front creases at bottoms even and on top of
each other up and down the leg, lay smooth on the table,
then fold backs over on fronts to meet front creases and
taper to nothing, to about six inches above the knee, then
fold legs, bringing the bottoms up level with the top of
trousers, so that bend will come about the knee or half
the entire length of trousers. Then place in box for
delivery. If, however, trousers are to be placed in a
paper package for delivery, or to be folded small
for packing, the following is an easy method, when backs
are folded over to meet the front creases, and legs are lying
smooth on the table, divide the entire length of the trousers
in three parts making two folds, one three inches below
the seat line or fork, the other about fifteen inches
from the bottom, place in paper to deliver.</p>

<p>When a suit is to be placed in a box for delivery, lay
trousers in first, (folded as first explained), the vest next
and the coat last, place cover on box, and wrap with heavy
cord to hold top and bottom together, also for convenience
when carrying.</p>

<p>Ladies' jackets and coats are folded the same as men's,
either short or long.</p>

<p>Ladies' skirts are folded in this manner, if plain, take
front of waist band in the right hand, and with the left<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
find center front of skirt at bottom, lay on table and fold
front over to meet the center back seam of skirt, then
fold double and place in box or package, for delivery.
When skirt is plaited see that the plaits lay in the proper
creases, and fold as explained above, being careful not to
make too small a package so as not to crush.</p>

<p>The firm name should be printed on the cover of the
box together with these words, "Please unpack and place
on hangers as soon as received." This prevents clothes
from wrinkling badly. The customer's name and address
should be written plainly in the space left for that purpose
on the cover of the box.</p>

<p>When sending a package by express or other carrying
companies, it is best to mark the value of the contents
of the package on the cover.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2>LESSON IX.</h2>

<h3>TESTING WOOLEN CLOTH AND SILK.</h3>


<p><b>Testing woolen cloth and silk</b>: The great value of
wool as a fibre, lies in the fact that it is strong, elastic,
soft and very susceptible to dye stuffs, and being woven,
furnishes a great number of air spaces, thereby rendering
clothing made from it very warm and light.</p>

<p>Wool may be dissolved completely by a warm solution
of caustic soda.</p>

<p>Cloth may be tested by unravelling a corner of a
piece of cloth, lighting it with a match. If the flame runs
along, and goes out, leaving a brown ash, and is smooth
when rubbed between the thumb and finger, it contains
cotton. If it burns and curls up into a ball at the end,
and goes out, and the ashes black like charcoal, and is
gritty when rubbed between the thumb and finger, it is
a pretty sure indication, that it is all wool.</p>

<p>The strength of a piece of cloth, may be tested by a
thread removed from the goods, by holding one end with
the right hand, and the other with the left. Pull, and if
it breaks off short, it is not a strong piece of goods, and
would not wear well; but if it pulls out long and stringy,
and upon examination one finds the fiber from one to two
inches long, this may be considered a good piece of goods,
and would wear well.</p>

<p>Silk may be tested by unravelling an end, and burning
the threads. If the ash is brown and is smooth when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
rubbed between the thumb and finger, this would not be
considered pure dye silk. If, however, when lighted, it
curls up into a ball at the end, and goes out, and the ash
black and when rubbed between the thumb and finger,
and is gritty like charcoal, one may feel sure that it is
pure dye stuff and will give excellent wear and will not
crack.</p>

<h2>LESSON XI.</h2>

<h3>HOW TO DRESS AND WHAT TO WEAR.</h3>


<p><b>How to dress well.</b> The first thought to consider in
supplying our wardrobe, is the material. Let it be of
good quality. Cheap stuff is never good unless it is good
quality at a low price.</p>

<p>One good suit of clothes, or dress, gives better satisfaction
(in lasting qualities, appearance and general makeup)
than two suits at the same price.</p>

<p>A well selected piece of goods, tailored by a reliable
tailor, always looks well, and may be kept repaired, cleaned
and pressed into shape occasionally, a fact that few men
properly understand. While the low priced suit never
has the look of that of a well fitted tailored suit, and cannot
be kept looking as neat.</p>

<p>Made to order garments are always fitted and made
better (if by a reliable maker). In this way, one has the
privilege of trying on and be fitted; then when a perfect
pattern has been made for you, your future garments may
be made from that pattern (changing the style of course,
but keeping the fitting points the same as the pattern.)</p>

<p>Men and women have their individual peculiarities,
such as one shoulder low, or one may be sloping shouldered,
another square, erect and stooping, etc. All these different
variations must be taken into consideration when
making custom made garments (or garments made to one's
individual measurements), and all well dressed men and
women should have their garments made to order. They
are more easily cleaned, pressed and repaired, for their
building and make up has been studied and put together
by skilled mechanics.</p>

<p>Men of limited capital who do not wish to spend much
money on dress, should wear dark materials for suitings.
Dark morning suits may be worn on many occasions
when a light suit would be bad taste. Fashion should be
followed, but avoid extremes. The wrinkles and bags
at the knees should be pressed out frequently. Close
woven cloth keeps its shape in garments better. The vest
should always be buttoned. Remove buttons on all garments
as soon as they show sign of wearing, and replace
with new.</p>

<p>Skirted coats and vests should be made to fit closely
around the waist, and loose over the chest to give the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
wearer that athletic appearance. This tends to make the
wearer stand straighter.</p>

<p>On the other hand, if a coat or vest is tight over the
chest, it tends to make the wearer stoop. The carriage of
men who do not wear suspenders, is generally better than
those who wear them.</p>

<p>When a single breasted coat or vest is too tight across
the chest, in many cases it is beyond remedy, as the tailor
cannot add anything to the front after the garment is
completed.</p>

<p>Double breasted coats and vests, however, are different,
on these; the buttons may be moved a trifle toward the
front edge, thereby giving more breathing room over the
chest, which is very much needed, and adds to the appearance
of the garment.</p>

<p>Single breasted sack overcoats, with fly front, are
most desirable from every point of view. The man of
taste and refinement always selects dark, quiet colors for
his overcoats.</p>

<p>Men of taste who carry canes, select those that are
strong, plain, light and small. Large canes are in very
bad taste for young men.</p>

<p>A white necktie should never be worn except with a
full dress suit, save by clergymen, and a few elderly men
who never wear any other color.</p>

<p>A high silk hat should not be worn with a sack suit.
A low hat should not be worn with a double breasted frock
or Prince Albert.</p>

<p>Straw hats should not be worn, only with light summer
suits. Dark suits are preferred on Sundays, especially
in town, and light suits should never be worn to church
anywhere.</p>

<p>Double breasted frock coats should be made of black
or grey materials.</p>

<p>At small informal gatherings, most men consider
themselves sufficiently dressed when they wear black frock
coats and dark trousers. It is not necessary for men to
wear dress suits where ladies are required to be in full
dress. At public entertainments, restaurants and cafes,
for example, where the ladies wear their bonnets, the man
who wears a black frock coat, dark trousers, and light kid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
gloves, is better dressed; because more appropriately, than
he, who wears a full dress suit.</p>

<p>'Tis true, the practice of wearing such a suit occasions
additional expense, as otherwise a business suit, or walking
suit, and a dress suit may be made to serve all occasions.</p>

<p>When at home, every man goes in for comfort, however
it will be well to remember that it is not polite
to appear at the table, whether they are strangers or not,
or will show himself to any one with whom he is not on
a familiar footing, in his shirt sleeves.</p>

<p>A gentleman for an evening visit, should always be in
evening dress. Dress coat, vest and trousers, white linen
and white cravat (a black cravat is permissible, but not in
full dress.)</p>

<p>For a dinner party, ball or opera, a man must wear a
white cravat. Watch fob is very fashionable.</p>

<p>On Sunday afternoons and evening at home, gentlemen
are permitted to wear frock coats, and to regard the
day as an "off" one, unless invited to a grand dinner, then
you must wear the dress suit.</p>

<p>Men are always ungloved, except when riding or
driving.</p>

<p>Colored shirts and flannel shirts are worn in the morning,
often until the dinner hour in the summer, and it is
proper to go to an informal breakfast in the informal dress
of the tennis ground.</p>

<p>For a formal luncheon, a man must dress himself in
black frock coat, a colored necktie, and grey or drab stripe
trousers, and white shirt.</p>

<p>For lawn tennis,&mdash;flannel shirts, rough coats, knickerbockers,
long grey, woolen stockings, and string shoes.</p>

<p>Simplicity, neatness, and fitness mark the gentleman.</p>

<p>Good clothes, manners, breeding, and education, admit
one to the better circles of society. It is not sufficient
to do as others do, but we must dress as they do when we
go out in the world.</p>

<p>He is best dressed, whose dress attracts least attention,
and in order to attract attention, one's dress must be
seasonable, appropriate, and conform to the prevailing
fashion, without going to extreme, and to appear comfortable.</p>

<p>For morning and afternoon wear, the tailor made suit

dress walking boot, patent leather, lace or button with
cloth tops.</p>

<p>For outing wear, the coat sweater for skating, golfing,

<p>For misses' and children's dresses made of the same

or double breasted, to button high around the neck or
roll low.</p>

<p>For house wear, the plain tailored shirt waist suit in becoming
colors are good form.</p>

<p>For school and street wear, the short skirt, coat three-quarters<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
or seven-eighths long and made of rough material
is the more stylish, and is made in a variety of styles.</p>

<p>Gloves for evening wear, Suede, Mousquetaire, elbow
and above; length arranging in buttons from eight to
twenty-four. In tan, mode, slate, pearl, lavender, yellow,

<p>For automobiling, double and single breasted long
loose coats, made in a variety of styles, water and dust
proof, plain or fancy trimmed, with wind cuffs inside of
sleeves, with velvet collars and cuffs.</p>

<p>Material used are rubber faced goods, Mohairs, Chambrays,
Satins, Oxfords and Tan plaids, changeable silks
and Crepe de Chines.</p>

<p>When selecting goods for dresses or jackets, bear in
mind that stripes lengthen, plaids, checks and light materials
broaden, and enlarge the person's appearance.</p>

<p><b>Boys' and youths' clothing from four to eighteen.</b>
The materials used for boys' suits, include all the staple
cloths, such as unfinished worsteds in stripes and plaids,
tweeds, dark and blue serge, plain cheviots, and Scotch
mixtures, homespun and corduroy.</p>

<p>The sailor suit is more suitable for the younger boy,
and may be made of various materials, such as white, blue,
and brown serge or cheviot, and trimmed with braid in
a variety of styles, as occasion require and surroundings
permit.</p>

<p>The most favorite style for the boy who has outgrown
the sailor suit, is the Norfolk coat, single or double breasted,
with double or single box plaits, made with or without
straight or pointed yoke.</p>

<p>The next in popularity, comes the double or single
breasted sack coat; with this and the above, bloomers may
be worn, finished at the knee with a buckled band.</p>

<p>The straight trousers are much worn and preferred by
some boys, and are considered more dressy when worn
with a plaited skirt bosom with attached cuffs, pointed
Eaton collar, and a narrow four-in-hand scarf and patent
or dull leather shoes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>For every day wear, the plain negligee shirt with yoke
back and attached cuffs are worn. With this style shirt,
the younger boys from eight to twelve, wear the stiff linen
or soft white pique, Eaton collar with round or square
corners, or a turn down collar of which the latter is most
popular.</p>

<p>The Windsor bow or the narrow four-in-hand scarf
may be worn with the Eaton collar.</p>

<p>For outing, a soft flannel negligee style made perfectly
plain, with straight attached or the new turn back cuffs, a
soft turn down collar attached to the shirt is preferred by
some, while others wear the separate linen collar, and have
the neck band finished plain. This style of white turndown
collar may be worn on all occasions until the age
of eighteen, at which time, he may wear almost any style
on the maturer man, providing his size will permit.</p>

<p>The plaited shirt bosom is the more dressy style, and
may be of white or light colors, with stripes and figures or
in solid colors. Young boys do not wear attached cuffs
until they are twelve years old, and only then if full grown.</p>

<p>For small parties, dancing classes or weddings, a boy
under sixteen may wear a dark blue serge double breasted
sack suit or the Norfolk style with bloomers or straight
trousers.</p>

<p>A plain white or finely striped white plaited shirt with
turn-over collar and dark narrow four-in-hand scarf is in
good taste with dull leather or patent leather Oxfords.</p>

<p><b>Boys' overgarments</b>:&mdash;For boys up to twelve, wear
the straight double breasted box overcoat; for the older
boy, they may be semi-fitting and slightly tapering at the
waist, and medium length; storm coats are very long and
much box, the materials include fancy Tweeds, Diagonals,
Cheviots, Beaver and Kerseys.</p>

<p>At the age of fifteen or sixteen, a boy will require a
more distinctive type of evening dress, and for these, the
Tuxedo or Dinner Coat is most recommended. The
Tuxedo or Dinner Suit may be made of unfinished worsted,
diagonal, twills, in black or dark blue, with pointed lapels
or shawn collar, silk or satin faced to the edge, and finished
with one button.</p>

<p>A black or grey vest may be worn with black tie, but
if the occasion be very formal, a white vest and white tie
may be substituted, with patent leather pumps.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>After a boy has reached the age of eighteen or nineteen,
he may adopt the styles of men in scarfs, waist coats,
evening clothes, gloves, etc.</p>

<h2>LESSON XII.</h2>

<h3>BUSINESS ETIQUETTE.</h3>


<p>Business etiquette. Your duty to your customer requires
you to treat them with respect, to do the work to
the best of your ability, to give them the best work of your
head and hands, and to treat your customers with politeness
to show a disposition to please and be a lady or gentleman
at all times.</p>

<p>Be independent, but not impertinent.</p>

<p>Do your best to please your customers. Never
promise to have garments finished at a given time unless
you intend to have them finished at the time promised,
and never disappoint a customer if it can possibly be
avoided.</p>

<p>Never misrepresent. A reputation for integrity is
of almost or quite as much value in your business as a
reputation for skill and taste.</p>

<p>Your most valuable customers are refined ladies and
gentlemen; you will do well therefore to bear in mind that
gentlemen love gentlemen.</p>

<p>Do not breathe in a customer's face.</p>

<p>Dress well, and let your linen be clean; your garments
kept well cleaned, pressed and repaired.</p>

<p>Your appearance is a part of your capital in the way
of getting business.</p>

<p>When you have garments that have been ready for
customers one month, notify them, saying that you will
hold them for thirty days longer. Say that in the meantime
you wish they would call for them.</p>

<p>Everything for the cleaning, repairing and pressing
of clothes may be had at this office. Send samples or explanation
of what is required and price list will be forwarded
to any address. These goods are sold at the lowest
possible margin of profit for handling same, and only
to those of our students who have bought the method.</p>

<p>The following is a partial list of what may be had:</p>

<p>Press-jacks, tables, irons, sponge cloths prepared,
brushes, scissors, sewing machines, mirrors, desks, chairs,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
coat, vest, trouser, jacket, and skirt hangers, racks to hang
clothes on, chalk, needles, thimbles, tape measures, basting
cotton, linen thread, silk thread, buttonhole twist, buttons
for coats, vests and trousers to match cloth. Sleeve
